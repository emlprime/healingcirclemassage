<h1>Appointments:</h1>

<div id="appointments_text">
<p>Due to the high influx of appointment requests from Groupon and some upcoming travel, I am currently booking into July. I do have another therapist who will be taking up the slack in the mean time. You're welcome to wait for me or contact me if you'd like to book with my other therapist. Thanks for your patience, we're getting to clients as quickly as possible. Also please note the Groupon now has a 12 month expiration date not 6 months.</p>
<p>Schedule your appointment today!</p>
<p>Please fill in all of the contact information below and we will be happy to give you a call. Please indicate your preferred time and date in the comments below.</p>
<p>All appointment requests must be confirmed to be final. If you don't hear from us within 24 hours, please call to confirm. Occasionally, the form has technical difficulties, and we value your business.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:healingcirclemassage@hotmail.com">healingcirclemassage@hotmail.com</a> or call me at (805) 680-1984.</p>

I mean, what concrete knowledge could a 'massage therapist' have to impart to our highly educated human resource professionals who are protective of their very valuable time away from the office these days?  Well, I could never have imagined.  Kathy Gruver not only packed the house but she packed the hour with an amazing presentation that did far more than impart knowledge on keeping employees happy and healthy in the workplace.  The far more valuable impression the made was on the lives of those in the room who were **inspired and touched** for their own health's sake.  I am still receiving emails and having conversations with those who were in attendance that day and say that they have been **changed for the better just from spending that one precious hour with Kathy Gruver**.  We will definitely be inviting her back as **one of our most requested premier speakers** next year."

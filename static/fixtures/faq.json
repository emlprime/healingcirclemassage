It goes to where it is needed and heals on all levels: Body, mind and spirit.

There are 3 levels of Reiki; I, II and Reiki Master, which I am, giving the ability to pass the attunements, i.e. give Reiki to others to use. The title Reiki Master simply means that you can pass attunements and teach others.\r\n\r\nMy Reiki healings consist of crystal and gemstone placement on the chakras and a full body session of energy work. An attunement may follow if the client is interested in continuing the healing on herself or others.",
